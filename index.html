            <span>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  I read this cover-to-cover in one sitting, but find myself continually referring back to it.  <i>(James A. Ramsey)</i></span> 
            <span>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  A very good introduction to the hobby, by someone who invested time and money learning the proper way to do FPV. <i>(R. Pietrantoni)</i></span>
            <span>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  Well laid out and flowed logically. Excellent explanations regarding the technology along with the pros and cons of the varied options. </i>(M.Martin)</i></span>
            <span>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  Very informative and comprehensive. The most useful information available much better than any web pages. Worth the investment. <i>(Andy Bush)</i></span>            
			<span>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  The advice is very good, and laid out very step by step. You can try taking shortcuts, but they will cost you and in the end probably won't save you time. <i>(R.Bohn)</i></span>
			<span>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  Good book for someone like me just getting into FPV. Explained the terminology very well. <i>(David Steppy)</i></span>

				In the last few years the first person view phenomenon has taken the RC world by storm. It has brought an entirely new field to the hobby with new thrills and challenges. Despite this, FPV remains a hobby that requires a steep learning curve, significant research, a decent investment and a lot of trial and error. 
				<br><br>
				This book is a beginner’s guide to FPV piloting. It intends to bring the reader from zero knowledge of the subject to a position where they can safely conduct FPV flights. 
				<br><br>
				It covers the broad range of necessary topics such as vehicle selection, control link, video link, component placement, ground station design, interference troubleshooting, and tips for successful flights. It provides photographs of commonly used equipment and schematics of typical setups – including a detailed case study on the author’s own configurations. 
				<br><br>
				The must-have guide for any hobbyist new to the exciting world of FPV.
