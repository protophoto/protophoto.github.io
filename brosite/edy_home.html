			<p id="paragraph">Having found home in yoga – a place where the breath is deep and full, and the mind quietens – I explore and celebrate Vinyasa Flow and its unique ability to connect the breath with movement, making it a meditation in motion that encourages awareness, a sense of curiosity, and self-discovery.
			<br><br>
			My practice is about meeting anything I discover with non-judgement and non-attachment, honouring the body and accepting its limitations. It is about surrender and connection: surrendering to what is and connecting to myself, others, and all that surrounds me.
			<br><br>
			Seeing the presence and openness that I found on my mat, eventually flow into the entirety of my life was a key moment for me. It felt like discovering a new language that allowed me to express my inner world.
			<br><br>
			Yoga is a journey and I am forever learning, helped by my dedicated personal practice, my teachers, and my students.
			<br><br>
			Ι teach Vinyasa Flow in London and use creative sequences to make every class different, while guiding with care and offering modifications to suit all levels. I am passionate about sharing all that I know and about witnessing yoga’s healing capacity.
